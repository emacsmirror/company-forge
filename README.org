The =company-forge= is a
[[https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode][company-mode]] completion
backend for [[https://github.com/magit/forge][forge]].  It uses current =forge=
repository data to offer completions for assignees (~@~ mentions of users and
teams) and topics (~#~ (or ~!~ for GitLab) references to issues, discussions,
and pull requests).

** Features
:properties:
:custom_id: features
:end:
- Offer completion after entering ~@~ and ~#~ (or ~!~ for GitLab).
- Support for users, teams, issues, discussions, and pull requests.
- Suppoet for different matching types (see =company-forge-match-type=).
- Display [[https://github.com/primer/octicons][octicons]] for candidates (see
  ~company-forge-icons-mode~).
- Display issues, discussions, and pull-request text as a documentation with
  =quickhelp-string= and =doc-buffer= =company= commands.
- Provide ~company-forge-completion-at-point-function~ compatible with built in
  command ~completion-at-point~.

** Installation
:properties:
:custom_id: installation
:end:
*** Installing from MELPA
:properties:
:custom_id: installing-from-melpa
:end:
The easiest way to install and keep =company-forge= up-to-date is using Emacs'
built-in package manager.  =company-forge= is available in the MELPA
repository.  Refer to https://melpa.org/#/getting-started for how to install a
package from MELPA.

Please see [[#configuration][Configuration]] section for example configuration.

You can use any of the package managers that supports installation from MELPA.
It can be one of (but not limited to): one of the built-in =package=,
=use-package=, or any other package manger that handles autoloads generation,
for example (in alphabetical order)
[[https://github.com/emacscollective/borg][Borg]],
[[https://github.com/progfolio/elpaca][Elpaca]],
[[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa][Quelpa]], or
[[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][straight.el]].


*** Installing from GitHub
:properties:
:custom_id: installing-from-github
:end:
The preferred method is to use built-in =use-package=.  Add the following to
your Emacs configuration file (usually =~/.emacs= or =~/.emacs.d/init.el=):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results value silent
(use-package company-forge
  :vc (:url "https://github.com/pkryger/company-forge.el.git"
       :rev :newest)))
#+end_src

Please refer to [[#configuration][Configuration]] section for example configuration.

** Configuration
:properties:
:custom_id: configuration
:end:
This section assumes you have =company-forge='s autoloads set up at Emacs startup.
If you have installed =company-forge= using built-in =package= or =use-package=
then you should be all set.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results value silent
(use-package company-forge
  :config
  (company-forge-icons-mode) ;; Display icons
  (advice-add #'forge--pull ;; Reset cache after forge pull
              :filter-args #'company-forge-reset-cache-after-pull)
  (add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-forge))
#+end_src

As an alternative to using ~company-forge~ backend (which is a recommended way)
a function ~company-forge-completion-function~ can be used.  This function has
been designed to be used in ~completion-at-point-functions~ and can be added
there with, for example:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results value silent
(add-hook 'completion-at-point-functions
            #'company-forge-completion-at-point-function)
#+end_src

The user option ~company-forge-capf-doc-buffer-function~ controls how the
documentation buffer (and =company-posframe= quickdoc) is displayed in such a
case.

** Customization
:properties:
:custom_id: customization
:end:
Below is a list of configuration options and optional functions with their
synopses that can be used to customize =company-forge= behavior.  Please refer
to documentation of respective symbol for more details.

- user option: =company-forge-match-type=: define how to match candidates
- user option: =company-forge-predicate=: a buffer predicate to control if the
  backend is enabled
- user option: =company-forge-use-cache=: control whether cache is used for
  candidates retrieval
- user option: =company-forge-capf-doc-buffer-function=: a function used do
  show documentation when =company= backend ~company-capf~ is used
- minor mode: =comany-forge-icons-mode=: control whether to display icons for
  candidates
- function: =company-forge-reset-cache-after-pull=: designed as a
  =:filter-args= advice for =forge--pull=
